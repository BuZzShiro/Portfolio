				Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find examples of my 3D modeling and 3D renders, and my programming development process.
			</div>
			<div class="MainSection Right">I absolutely love making 3D art and programming... also vector art, making websites, attempting to make music, game development in Unity, basically anything creative you can do on a computer.
				<br>I am 34 years old and have been using computers since I was 7 years old back in the days when you only had 256mb of storage space and 32mb of ram.
				<br>My father taught himself programming by getting books from specialist bookshops(before everything was online), has worked for a few start up companies and many different companies including Bloomberg, Barclays, Citibank.
				<br>He has taught me everything he knows, from testing and debuging to development and most importantly the mindset needed to be a great programmer.
				<br>My goal is to get a job where I can perfect my skills, learn from skilled profesionals and help to develop great projects.
			</div>
			<div class="MainSection Right">As a 3D artist, I take pride in creating realistic and eye-catching models that capture the essence of their
			real-life counterparts. Whether it's creating characters, environments, or objects, I love bringing my imagination to life in 3D.
			</div>
			<img src="Images/SVG/Languages.svg" class="LanguagesImg">
			<div class="MainSection Left">I'm also proficient in 3D rendering using Blender. With its powerful tools and intuitive interface, I'm able to
			create stunning 3D scenes that can be used for anything from architectural visualizations to product designs. I take great care in every
			aspect of the rendering process, from lighting and texturing to compositing and post-processing.
			</div>
			<div class="MainSection Right">In addition to my 3D skills, I'm also well-versed in Unity game development. From creating complex game mechanics
			to designing immersive worlds, I'm passionate about using technology to create unforgettable gaming experiences.
			</div>
			<div class="MainSection Left">As a programmer, I enjoy solving complex problems and creating efficient and user-friendly software. Whether it's
			writing code in Python, C++, or JavaScript, I take pride in delivering high-quality solutions to any project.
			</div>
			<div class="MainSection Right">Finally, I'm experienced in website development, crafting beautiful and responsive websites that are tailored to my
			clients' needs. Whether it's designing a brand new website from scratch or optimizing an existing site, I always strive for excellence in everything I do.</div>
